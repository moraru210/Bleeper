# Bleeper
> Asks the user to input a word that they wants to 'bleep' in a text by replacing
the whole length of the word with asterisks. It overwrites the text file given
as input by creating a temp file and placing the modified text in the file, 
and then swapping the temp file for the input file at the end.

to run it, just compile main.c by using the makefile and then run the binary
file.
